This is a test project where I try to learn the SDL libraries. The project is set up for Qt Creator and uses QMake to compile. 

External libraries:

* SDL2 (2.0.5)
* SDL2_image (2.0.1)
* SDL2_mixer (2.0.1)
* SDL2_ttf (2.0.5)

Cred: 

* Sprite sheet: https://www.spriters-resource.com/arcade/spaceinv/sheet/8593/
* Font: https://fonts2u.com/space-invaders-regular.font
* Sound: http://www.classicgaming.cc/classics/space-invaders/sounds
